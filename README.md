# Overview

Hello, and welcome to my first flutter repository.

This repository serves as an attempt to build a registration form with flutter to get built with
Android, iOs, Web, Windows, Linux, and macOS.

It is the beginning of my learning path with this language.

### Getting Started

1. Install Flutter according to your Operational
   System [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Setup an editor [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio) (in this
   repository I', using Android Studio)
3. Clone the repository in the same directory as **laradock** and **sample_form_integration**
   directories are:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/bos21001/sample_registration_flutter.git
    ```

4. Run the app in the development mode:
   
   ```
   cd sample_registration_flutter
   ```
   
   ```
   flutter run
   ```
